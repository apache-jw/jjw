# About Me
Welcome to my personal website! My name is James Wieland, originally from the vibrant city of Austin, Texas, and currently furthering my education at Indiana University Bloomington, where I am completing my Master's in Information Systems. In my leisure time, I am an avid mountain biker, a passionate supporter of Austin FC and Arsenal football clubs, and a music enthusiast who enjoys exploring new tunes and sharing them with friends.

Professionally, my journey has been diverse and enriching. I have honed my skills as an automotive technician in a local Austin shop, ventured into the tech world with a SaaS company affiliated with a major automotive OEM, and contributed as a supply chain analyst for another leading automotive OEM. These experiences have equipped me with a unique blend of technical and analytical skills, which I am eager to leverage in the technology sector. As I navigate through my professional path, I am committed to continual learning and growth, aiming to make meaningful contributions to the technology landscape.
